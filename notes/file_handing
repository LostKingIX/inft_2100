1.1 File Handling

Define - the process of working on files that are stored
locally

- can store files in "flat" files (logs, xml)
    - flat files are slower than database queries

# Opening files streams
    - file opened with fopen()
    - file closed with fclose()

**note webserver needs permission to read and write
    chmod 770 - gives file owner full permission and group (www-data) r/w/e permissions

    folder that the file is *within*
    chmod 770 giving file owner and group full permissions

# File Open Modes
r - read ONLY

r+ - reading and writing, starts at beginning of file

w - open for writing ONLY, removes all previous content, 
if file doesn't exist, create it

a - open writing, but start at end of current content (create if ness)

a+ - open for reading and writing, start at END and create file if ness

# example open/close

<?php 
    //opening file to read
    $reading_file = fopen ('untitled/file.txt', 'r');

    //opening file to write
    $writing_file = fopen ('untitled/file.txt', 'w');

    //closing both files
    fclose ($reading_file);
    fclose ($writing_file);
?>

# Writing Data

To write data to a file:
    fwrite($file_to_write, $data_to_write)

In this case, data_to_write is being written into the open file stream

# Data Writing Example
<?php
    //Opening file stream (a - opening file at beginning of file, append mode)
    $handle = fopen('contacts.txt', 'a');

    //Writing data into handle
    fwrite($handle,"\nJohn Doe:\tjdoe@gmail.com");

    //closing file stream
    fclose($handle);
?>

# Other file operations

delete file
    unlink("filename);

rename (file or directory)
    rename("old name", "new name");

copy file
    copy("source", "destination");

# Reading data

two main functions to read data: gets & read

**stops at pre-determined boundary
fgets($file_to_read, $limit_to_read)

**endlessly reads file to end of file (EOF)
fread($file_to_read, $limit_to_read)

when using EOF operating mode, EOF has to be handled appropriately

feof($file_to_read)
    returns true if (EOF) the end of the file has been reached

# Data Reading Example
<?php

    //opening file to be read in r ONLY mode, store into $handle

    $handle = fopen('contacts.txt', 'r');
    
    //while the file has not been read entirely, echo data from the $handle until 1024 bytes 

    while (!feof($handle)) 
        {
            echo fgets($handle, 1024);

            //line break
            echo '<br />';
        }
    
    //closing filestream
    fclose($handle);
?>

# File open shortcuts

two shortcut functions that don't require a file to be opened

$seperate_array_line = file ($file_to_read)
    reads an entire file into an array with each line as a seperate entry in the array

$single_str = file_get_contents ($file_to_read)
    reads an entire file into a single string
